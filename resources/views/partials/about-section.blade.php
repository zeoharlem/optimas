                <p><strong>Established in 1999, Optima Sports Management International (OSMi) is a leading sports marketing agency operating in Africa and the Diaspora. </strong></p>
                <p>OSMi has been a pioneer within the sector, and brought to life areas of sports marketing that had previously been untouched.</p>
                <p>OSMi‘s  reputation has been built through its partnerships with many of the world’s biggest rights owners, and its alliances with broadcasters across the continent of Africa and the Caribbean. 
                    OSMi helped to deﬁne sports media in Africa, serving hundreds of millions of previously unreached sports fans, and setting a new standard in FTA  sports distribution on the continent.
