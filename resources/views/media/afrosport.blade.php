                        Building on its broadcaster relationships, OSMi is deepening its coverage both in terms of its engagement and reach.  The Afrosport Network, a wholly owned subsidiary of OSMi, is a Pan-African sports media hub, connecting the worldâ€™s greatest sports events & athletes with fans in Africa and beyond, across all viewing platforms.
                    
                        The Network will deliver not only live sport but programming that will offer a level of mass engagement for Afrosport fans. Partnerships have already been established with broadcasters in the UK and Caribbean to expand the reach of the network and enrich the conversation.
